Angular connects a view with a module by using ng-app. Whatever value that is provided there is matched to a module name.
The one with the match owns the view.

Controller is nested within an app. When you specify a controller ng-controller, then it tries to match it to a controller that's within the app.
View is the HTML part and the model is the Javascript part that connects with it. Angular will keep the model and view bound.

Dependency injection - pass object into method instead of creating it inside the method.
